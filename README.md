## :currency_exchange: [Forecasting Silver Prices In Bullion Market in GBP](https://github.com/aritzLizoain/EUR-CHF-forecast/blob/main/Report.pdf)

The goal of this study is to fit an **ARIMA model** to forecast the price of silver in the Bullion Market in London, UK. The analysis reveals a differenced autoregessive model at lag 1 as the best model; consequently, an ARIMA(1,1,0) is fitted. The model is obtained by training 80% of the data and finding the prediction error based of the last six months of the data (test).The silver price predictions are obtained back-transforming the residual time series forecast.
